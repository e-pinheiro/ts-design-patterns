# Template Method Pattern Example in TypeScript

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Template Method design pattern using TypeScript. The Template Method pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class but lets subclasses override specific steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

## What is the Template Method Pattern?

The Template Method pattern is a behavioral design pattern that:
- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses
- Lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
- Protects the algorithm's core structure while allowing for variations in specific steps
- Reduces code duplication by moving common code into a base class

### When to Use?

Use the Template Method pattern when:
- You want to let clients extend only particular steps of an algorithm
- You have several classes that contain almost identical algorithms with some minor differences
- You want to avoid code duplication by moving common code into a base class
- You need to control the points where subclasses can vary an algorithm

### Common Use Cases:
- Data mining operations
- Build tools and compilers
- Framework development
- Document generation and processing
- Workflow or task processing systems

### Key Points:
1. The abstract base class declares the template method and primitive operations
2. Concrete classes implement the primitive operations
3. The template method defines the algorithm structure
4. Hook methods provide default behavior that subclasses can override

## Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

## Running the Application
```shell
npm run dev
```
expected output:
```shell
Initializing data process...
Processing data...
Performing custom cleanup...
Cleanup completed
```

## Coverage
```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

## Testing
Here's how to test the Template Method implementation:

```shell
npm test
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
- Eliminates code duplication by moving common code into a base class
- Provides a framework for varying parts of an algorithm
- Enforces a consistent structure across implementations
- Allows fine-grained control over algorithm extension points
- Facilitates maintenance by centralizing common code

### Disadvantages:
- Can be difficult to maintain if the algorithm is too complex
- Limited to inheritance-based customization
- May violate Liskov Substitution Principle if not carefully designed
- Can become confusing if there are too many template methods or hooks
- Restricted to single inheritance in some programming languages

## Best Practices

1. Clearly document which methods are hooks and which must be implemented
2. Keep the template method focused and not too complex
3. Consider making the template method final (where supported) to prevent override
4. Use meaningful names for abstract methods that describe their purpose
5. Provide sensible default implementations for hook methods when possible
