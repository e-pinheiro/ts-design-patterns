# Observer Pattern Example in TypeScript

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Observer design pattern using TypeScript. The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

## What is the Observer Pattern?

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that:
- Defines a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing
- Establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects
- Promotes loose coupling between subjects and observers
- Enables dynamic relationships between objects at runtime

### When to Use?

Use the Observer pattern when:
- Changes to one object require changing others, and you don't know how many objects need to be changed
- An object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are
- You need to maintain consistency between related objects without making them tightly coupled
- You want a publish-subscribe type of communication between objects

### Common Use Cases:
- Event handling systems
- User interface notifications
- Real-time data monitoring
- Stock market applications
- Social media feeds
- Newsletter subscription systems

### Key Points:
1. Subjects (Observables) maintain a list of observers and notify them of state changes
2. Observers register themselves with subjects to receive updates
3. Observers can subscribe and unsubscribe dynamically
4. Multiple observers can react to changes in a single subject

## Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

## Running the Application
```shell
npm run dev
```
expected output:

## Coverage
```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

## Testing
Here's how to test the Observer implementation:

```shell
npm test
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
- Establishes loose coupling between subjects and observers
- Supports broadcast communication
- Easy to add and remove observers at runtime
- Follows Open/Closed Principle
- Provides support for event-driven programming

### Disadvantages:
- Memory leaks if observers aren't properly unsubscribed
- Observers might be notified in an unpredictable order
- Complex update cycles can lead to cascading updates
- Can be challenging to debug with many observers
- Potential performance impact with many observers

## Best Practices

1. Implement unsubscribe mechanism to prevent memory leaks
2. Consider using weak references for observer storage
3. Avoid circular update cycles between observers
4. Keep observer notifications specific and meaningful
5. Consider using an event bus for complex observer relationships
