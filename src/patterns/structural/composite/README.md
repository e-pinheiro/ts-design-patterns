# Composite Pattern Example in TypeScript

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Composite design pattern using TypeScript. The Composite pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, letting clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## What is the Composite Pattern?

The Composite pattern is a structural design pattern that:
- Lets you compose objects into tree structures
- Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
- Creates a class hierarchy of simple and complex objects
- Implements a common interface for all objects in the composition

### When to Use?

Use the Composite pattern when:
- You want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
- You want clients to be able to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly
- You need to implement a tree-like structure of objects
- You want to create complex structures with simple and composite components

### Common Use Cases:
- File system structures (files and directories)
- GUI components and containers
- Organization hierarchies
- Menu systems with submenus
- Graphics rendering systems

### Key Points:
1. Components implement a common interface
2. Leaf nodes represent individual objects
3. Composite nodes can contain other components
4. Clients work with all elements through the common interface
5. Tree operations are handled uniformly across the structure

## Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
```

## Running the Application
```shell
npm run dev
```
expected output:
```shell
Department: Engineering
  Employee: John (Software Engineer)
  Employee: Alice (QA Engineer)
  Department: Frontend
    Employee: Bob (React Developer)
    Employee: Carol (UI Designer)
```

## Coverage
```shell
npm run test:coverage
```

## Testing
Here's how to test the Composite implementation:

```shell
npm test
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages:
- Simplifies client code by treating objects and compositions uniformly
- Makes it easier to add new types of components
- Provides flexibility in building tree structures
- Follows Open/Closed Principle for adding new components
- Creates clear hierarchical structures

### Disadvantages:
- Can make the design overly general
- Might be difficult to restrict components in compositions
- Can be challenging to maintain type safety in some cases
- May require additional logic to handle component-specific operations
- Could lead to deep object hierarchies that are hard to manage

## Best Practices

1. Define a clear and simple component interface
2. Consider implementing safeguards for type-specific operations
3. Use meaningful names for composite and leaf classes
4. Implement proper error handling for invalid operations
5. Consider implementing caching for expensive operations on large structures
