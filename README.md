# TypeScript Design Patterns

A collection of design patterns implemented in TypeScript with practical examples and unit tests.

## Overview

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference implementation for various software design patterns. Each pattern is implemented in TypeScript, accompanied by unit tests and real-world examples to demonstrate practical usage scenarios.

## Project Structure
```
src/
└── patterns/
    ├── creational/
    ├── structural/
    └── behavioral/
```

Each pattern implementation includes:
- TypeScript source code
- Unit tests
- Usage examples
- Documentation explaining the pattern

## Purpose

This project aims to:
- Provide clear, practical implementations of design patterns
- Demonstrate pattern usage in real-world scenarios
- Serve as a reference for TypeScript developers
- Help developers understand when and how to apply specific patterns

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns
Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms:
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype
- Singleton

### Structural Patterns
Patterns that focus on object composition and relationships:
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
Patterns that define communication between objects:
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Execute in dev mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Pattern Documentation Structure

Each pattern in the `src/patterns` directory follows this documentation structure:

### Problem
- Describes the issue or challenge the pattern addresses
- Explains when you might encounter this problem

### Context
- Provides background information
- Explains when to use (and when not to use) the pattern
- Discusses alternatives and trade-offs

### Solution
- Details the pattern's implementation
- Explains the structure and components
- Provides code examples
- Discusses benefits and potential drawbacks

### Examples
- Shows practical use cases
- Demonstrates pattern implementation in real scenarios
